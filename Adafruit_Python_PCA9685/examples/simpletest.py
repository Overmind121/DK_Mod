# Simple demo of of the PCA9685 PWM servo/LED controller library.
# This will move channel 0 from min to max position repeatedly.

# Import the PCA9685 module.
import Adafruit_PCA9685


# Uncomment to enable debug output.
#import logging
#logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Initialise the PCA9685 using the default address (0x40).
pwm = Adafruit_PCA9685.PCA9685()

# Alternatively specify a different address and/or bus:
#pwm = Adafruit_PCA9685.PCA9685(address=0x41, busnum=2)

# Configure min and max servo pulse lengths
#this is the bit resolution goes from 0 - 4095
servo_min = 229  # Min pulse length out of 4095
#1100 us
servo_middle = 310  # Max pulse length out of 4095
#1500 us
servo_max = 395  # Max pulse length out of 4095
#1900 us
#multiply by 4.8 to get the microseconds pulse width

'''
so here is how it goes
if you set the pulse to 4095 you will see this on your oscope

example freq is 50 hz so period the time the signal repeats (1/T =f)
is 0.02seconds
so that means 0.02 seconds or  20ms

measurement I made
    this is close to 1500us (measuring 310 = 1.490ms)
    ratio looks closer to 4.8 > 1490/310 = 4.8
    roughly 150 = 720 microseconds 4.8
    this is close to 1500us (measuring 310 = 1.490ms)
    ratio looks closer to 4.8 > 1490/310 = 4.8

# Set frequency to 60hz, good for servos. measured = 63.21hz
#pwm.set_pwm_freq(60)

pwm.set_pwm_freq(48)
#with my oscope i measure setting 48 in here
#to be closer to 50hz in real measurement (50.76hz)
#measured coming from receiver on donkeycar = 50hz

#every 60 times per second
